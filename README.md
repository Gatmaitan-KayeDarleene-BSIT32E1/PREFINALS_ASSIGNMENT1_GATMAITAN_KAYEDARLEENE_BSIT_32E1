Self-Assessment: Onion Architecture, MVC, and Web API (.NET Core) with Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Conceptual Understanding:
 
Onion Architecture: (Yes/No) 
Have you heard of the Onion Architecture principle in software design?
answer: NO
  
MVC Pattern: (Yes/No) 
Are you familiar with the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for building web applications?
answer: NO
  
Web API: (Yes/No)  
Do you understand the concept of building RESTful APIs using ASP.NET Core Web API?
answer: NO
 
Application & Bottlenecks:
Onion Architecture: 
Benefits: (1-3 keywords)
Briefly list some key benefits of using Onion Architecture in .NET Core projects. (e.g., separation of concerns, testability)
answer: Flexibility and Maintainability, Domain-centric Design, Cross-cutting Concerns, and Adaptability to Change
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain) 
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects? If so, briefly describe the bottleneck(s). (e.g., Increased complexity for simple projects, difficulty finding developers familiar with the pattern)
answer: YES, i've encountered challenges using the Onion Architecture because im not familiar in that kind of structure. There are some errors in the codes. 

MVC:
Components: (1-3 keywords each)
Briefly describe the roles of the Model, View, and Controller in the MVC pattern.
answer: 
Model: The application's data and business logic are represented by the model. It contains all of the behavior and state of the program, including data storage, manipulation, and validation. To retrieve and store data, models communicate with databases and other data sources.
View: The application's presentation layer is represented by the View. It is in charge of creating the user interface using the information that the Model provides. The user interface elements that are displayed to the user are often generated by views using HTML, CSS, and client-side scripting.
Controller: The Controller serves as a link for the View and the Model. It takes in user input from the View, applies the appropriate Model logic to it, and then refreshes the View. Controllers manage user requests, plan the data flow, and choose the response to provide to the client.

Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any challenges with tight coupling between Model and Controller in MVC projects? If so, briefly describe the issue(s). (e.g., Difficulty in unit testing controllers, logic changes rippling through the application)
answer: Yes, because the difficulty of testing , the dependency on framework, this makes it difficult to switch to a different framework or architecture in the future without significant refactoring.
 
Web API:
Differences from MVC: (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs? Briefly explain the main difference.
answer: The differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs, the MVC Traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller) applications are designed to serve dynamic web pages to users. They typically generate HTML content on the server and send it to the client for rendering in a web browser. Then the Web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are designed to facilitate communication between different software systems or components over the web. They expose endpoints that clients can interact with to request and exchange data in a structured format, often JSON or XML.
 
Bottlenecks (Encountered): (Yes/No and Briefly Explain)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs? If so, briefly describe the scenario(s). (e.g., Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach)
answer: In comparison to Web APIs, typical MVC applications may have issues with scalability, bandwidth utilization, tight coupling, client compatibility, asynchronous operations, and caching. However, they are excellent at creating dynamic web pages for user interaction. The application's unique requirements and limitations must be taken into consideration when selecting the architecture.
